# UCSI CTF 2025 Writeups

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of writeups for all the challenges I solved during the **UCSI CTF 2025**. Each writeup includes an overview of the challenge, the methodology used to approach it, an analysis of the intended vulnerabilities, and the final exploit or solution.  

The challenges span multiple categories:  
**Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Web Exploitation, Miscellaneous, AI (Hacking), Cryptography, and OSINT.**  

This repository is both a personal archive of my growth as a cybersecurity learner and a helpful guide for anyone preparing for future CTFs.
